Q.1) Write a python program to generate Calendar for the given month and year?

import calendar
def generate_calendar():
    # Get input for month and year
    year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
    month = int(input("Enter the month: "))

    # Validate input
    if 1 <= month <= 12:
        # Generate and print the calendar
        cal = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)
        month_name = calendar.month_name[month]

        print(f"\nCalendar for {month_name} {year}:\n")
        print("Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su")
        for week in cal:
            for day in week:
                if day == 0:
                    print("   ", end=" ")
                else:
                    print(f"{day:2} ", end=" ")
            print()
    else:
        print("Invalid month. Please enter a month between 1 and 12.")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_calendar()


Q.2) Write a Python program to implement Depth First Search algorithm. Refer the following graph
as an Input for the program.[Initial node=1,Goal node=7].


def dfs(graph, current, goal, visited):
    if current == goal:
        print("Goal node found!")
        return True
    visited.add(current)
    for neighbor in graph.get(current, []):
        if neighbor not in visited:
            if dfs(graph, neighbor, goal, visited):
                return True
    return False
graph = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [4, 5],
    3: [6, 7],
    4: [],
    5: [],
    6: [],
    7: []
}
initial_node = 1
goal_node = 7
visited_nodes = set()
if not dfs(graph, initial_node, goal_node, visited_nodes):
    print("Goal node not found.")
